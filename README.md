Netflix Stock Profile 2017
My job was to help financial analysts by creating some of the visualizations for a stock profile of Netflix.
I used SEABORN, PYPLOT, PANDAS libraries, Jupyter Notebook and Google Slides for the purposes of this project.
During this project, I have analyzed, prepared, and ploted data. Visualizations will help the financial analysts asses the risk of the Netflix stock.

Types of illustrations: side-by-side barplots, scatterplot, lineplot, violinboxplot.
